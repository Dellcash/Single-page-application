          Single-page applications have many advantages, such as speed, really
          good UX, and, as for developing for Drupal, the full control over the
          markup. More about the pros and cons of SPA in comparison with MPA
          read is here. There are more and more sites using SPA; there are more
          and more tools that simplify the process of developing complex SPA. If
          you read our articles (if not, then you should do it), you've probably
          read about Vue.js, and how you can use it in Drupal. If youâ€™re new to
          this site, Vue.js is a young reactive JavaScript framework created by
          a former employee of Google Evan You. I suggest you plunge deeper into
          Vue and consider writing a simple SPA. We will create a client-side
          application for a simple blog. This application will show a list of
          all articles, and also a full text of the article. And, of course, all
          changes will occur without reloading a page. With the example of this
          application, you will get to know how to fetch data in Vue, how to
          create a router and also you will learn about a very interesting
          concept - Vue single file components.
